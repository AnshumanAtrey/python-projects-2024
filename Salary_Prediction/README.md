# Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project involves building a Machine Learning model to predict salaries based on features like years of experience, education level, job title, and location. The goal is to help employers or job seekers estimate salaries accurately using data-driven techniques.

## Overview

The model is trained to predict salaries based on a variety of factors. These factors include:
- Years of experience
- Education level
- Job title
- Location
- Skills

The data is processed and analyzed to develop a regression model, allowing us to predict salaries for unseen data.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and feature engineering to handle missing values and categorical variables.
- **Modeling**: Multiple regression algorithms are tested, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²) to measure accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You'll also need the following libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib (optional for visualization)

You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Evaluation

The model’s performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data.
