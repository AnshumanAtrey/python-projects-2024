# Car Detection using OpenCV

This Python project uses the OpenCV library to detect cars in images using image recognition technology. The program processes any car image and identifies vehicles using a pre-trained classifier.

## Features
- Detects cars from any image containing vehicles.
- Uses OpenCVâ€™s object detection functionality.
- Simple and efficient, capable of handling multiple images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python` package)

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your car images in this same folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. The program will process the images and display the results, showing detected cars with bounding boxes.
