# Custom cryptography with stegnography
Secure Transmission of Data Using Cryptography &amp; LSB Steganography

1. Public Key Generation
2. DNA chain based custom encryption
3. Robust AES encryption for more security
4. Digital Signature using private key

# *Steganography*
Use an image to hide your data within the least significant bits of the image. The encoded image appears same as the original image and no changes are visible to the naked eye.
