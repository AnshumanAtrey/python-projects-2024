# 🌐 IP Address Finder

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `python main.py`
3. Get amazed by the power of networking!

## 🧠 What's This?

This nifty little Python script is your ticket to the wonderful world of IP addresses! It's like a magic wand that reveals the secret identities of computers on the internet. 🧙‍♂️

## 🛠 Features

- 🏠 Discovers your computer's hostname
- 🔍 Unveils your local IP address
- 🌍 Finds the IP address of any website (default: github.com)

## 🐍 How It Works

This script uses Python's `socket` module to perform its wizardry. Here's what it does:

1. Finds out your computer's name (hostname)
2. Discovers your computer's IP address
3. Looks up the IP address of github.com (or any other website you specify)

## 🎭 Sample Output

```
Your Hostname is: COOL-COMPUTER
Your IP Address is: 192.168.1.100
The IP Address of github.com is: 140.82.121.4
```

## 🚀 Customization

Want to find the IP of a different website? No problem! Just change the `host` variable in the script:

```python
host = "your-favorite-website.com"
```
