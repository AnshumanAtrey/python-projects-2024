## Requirements

- Python 3.6+

- Pillow (PIL)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Click "Open Image" to select a PNG file
3. Preview your image in the application window
4. Click "Convert to JPG" to convert the image
5. The converted JPG will be saved in the same directory as the original PNG

## How It Works

The application uses:
- **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)** for image processing
- Native file dialog for file selection
- Automatic RGBA to RGB conversion for PNG images

## Interface Elements

- Original filename is preserved (just changes extension)
